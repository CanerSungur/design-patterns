Observer establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, where a change in one object(subject) automatically notifies all its dependent objects(observers) without them being tightly coupled.

This pattern facilitates better communication and modularity in your game.

BENEFITS;
- Promote loose coupling between objects
- Improve code organization and maintainability
- Simplify communication between game objects
